        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Morgan, and I'm really excited about answering cool questions using data. I have formal education in bioinformatics and a passion for solving medical problems, but I also like to apply my data science skills to my other interests, like music and creative writing.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Adapted spatial statistics techniques from GIS and ecology to identify spatial patterns of cells that contribute to disease progression. Developed reusable pipelines (such as my <a href="https://github.com/morganoneka/GFunctionAnalysis">G-function pipeline</a>) to generalize downstream analysis for any coordinate-based biological data, reducing turnaround times and enabling collaboration with over a dozen labs. </li>
<li>Generated graph representations of biological images, then used graph embedding and supervised graph classification to identify cell-pair interactions associated with disease progression. Created a <a href="https://github.com/morganoneka/DiNeR">ggplot-based visualization package</a> for R to facilitate network topology comparison.</li>
<li>Led conversations with collaborators and delivered insights to multidisciplinary teams, following the project lifecycle from data preparation to deployment.</li>
<li>Contributed to <a href=" https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9672-0445">7 peer-reviewed publications</a>, several additional publications in preparation, local & international conference presentations, and multiple successful R01 grant applications.</li>

        <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

          <div class="col-sm-12 desc">
        <p>I love talking to people about the things I'm passionate about! I do my best to include useful tutorials in my code, and I jump at opportunities to give informative presentations.</p>

        <p>During my time at U of M, I have volunteered with the Carpentries, Girls Who Code, and UMySci as an educator and curriculum developer.</p>

        <p>While at GVSU, I worked as a Math & Stats tutor for 2 years, tutoring a variety of courses from intro statistics to abstract algebra. I also spent 3 years working as a lab assistant for CIS 162 (intro computer science) labs, and was a grader for a senior-level computer architecture course. </p>
