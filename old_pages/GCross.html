         <p>Cytotoxic T-cells, or CTLs, are also known as "killer T-cells" and play a major role in killing abnormal cells, including tumor cells. </p>
         <p>Then, when CTLs are physically close to tumor cells, we can infer that this will lead to a positive outcome for the patient, because the CTL will kill many of the tumor cells. We call this infiltration—the CTLs have infiltrated the tumor cells, meaning the two populations of cells are intertwined.</p>
         <p>To the left are plots of two different samples. Sample 1 has high infiltration of CTLs into tumor cells; the CTLs and tumor cells are mixed together fairly evenly. Sample 2 has low infiltration; while there are some tumor cells that have CTLs near them, most tumor cells do not have a CTL nearby, as the CTLs have clustered together in one area of the sample.</p>
         <p>This is a phenomenon we can see easily with the naked eye. But how quantify the level of infiltration objectively?</p>

        <h2>What is the G-Cross Function?</h2>
        <p>The G-Cross function is a function of a radius, R. The function returns the probability that a reference cell has a non-reference cell within R units of it.</p>
        <p>In the context of CTLs and tumors, G(R) gives the probability that a tumor has a CTL within R units.</p>
